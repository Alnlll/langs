    "\n",
    "Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code’s organization, including which details are exposed, which details are private, and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes collectively referred to as the *module system*, include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Packages**: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates\n",
    "- **Crates**: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable\n",
    "- **Modules** and **use**: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths\n",

    "Crate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `crate` is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time.\n",
    "- A `crate` can come in one of two forms:\n",
    "    - a binary crate: executable to be compiled on, must have the `main` function.\n",
    "    - a library crate: define functionality intended to be shared with multiple projects.\n",
    "- The `crate root` is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of a crate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `package` is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of functionality.\n",
    "- A `package` contains a `Cargo.toml` file that describes how to build those crates.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Start from the crate root** : When compiling a crate, the compiler first looks in the crate root file.\n",
    "  - src/lib.rs for lib crate\n",
    "  - src/main.rs for binary crate\n",
    "- **Declaring modules** : In the crate root file, you can declare new modules. say with `mod garden;`, the compiler will look for:\n",
    "  - inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following `mod garden`\n",
    "  - in the file `src/garden.rs`\n",
    "  - in the file `src/garden/mod.rs`\n",
    "- **Declaring submodules**: In any file other than the crate root, you can declare submodules. e.x. `mod vegetables;` in `src/garden.rs`:\n",
    "  - Inline, directly following `mod vegetables`, within curly brackets instead of the semicolon\n",
    "  - in the file `src/garden/vegetables.rs`\n",
    "  - `src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs`\n",
    "- **Paths to code in modules**: Once a module is part of your crate, you can refer to code in that module from anywhere else in that same crate.\n",
    "  For example, an `Asparagus` type in the garden vegetables module would be found at `crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`\n",
    "- **Private vs public**: Code within a module is private from its parent modules by default.\n",
    "- **The `use` keyword**: you can create a shortcut with `use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;`, then could write only `Asparagus`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `module tree` should be defined in `src/lib.rs`, then, any public items can be used in the binary crate by\n",
    "starting paths wit hthe name of the package. The binary crate becomes a user of the library crate just like a completely external crate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting Relative Paths with super\n",
    "\n",
    "We can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than the current module or the crate root, by using `super` at the start of the path. Which works like he `..` syntax in a filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `super` allows us to reference an item that knonw in parent module, which can make rearranging the model tree easier when the moldule is closely related to the parent.\n",
